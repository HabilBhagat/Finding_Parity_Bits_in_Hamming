Aim : 
To find and calculate parity bits in hamming data set.

Theory : 
Hamming code is a set of error-correction code s that can be used to detect and 
correct bit errors that can occur when computer data is moved or stored. 
Hamming code is named for R. W. Hamming of Bell Labs.
Hamming code makes use of the concept of parity and parity bits, 
which are bits that are added to data so that the validity of the data can be 
checked when it is read or after it has been received in a data transmission. 
Using more than one parity bit, an error-correction code can not only identify a 
single bit error in the data unit, but also its location in the data unit.
